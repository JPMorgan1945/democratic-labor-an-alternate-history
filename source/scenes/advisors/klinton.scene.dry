= Mountllary Klinton

Klinton wants a change of pace… she wants to do more… to fight for more… although she’s exceptional in the courtroom, she feels she should put her skills towards helping even more people. Klinton may be a small boat in the middle of a vast ocean right now, but perhaps… with a little bit of hard work… she can send big waves into motion.
